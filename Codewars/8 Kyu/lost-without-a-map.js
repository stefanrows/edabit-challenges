// Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

// For example:

// [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

// For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.

const array1 = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

const map1 = array1.map((x) => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
